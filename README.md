This is a Bluepill-compatible devboard for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.
It uses all through-hole parts except for the STM32F103C8T6/STM32F103CBT6 microcontroller
and is intended to be an alternative to the Bluepill that is easier to assemble
should the Bluepill not be available or suitable.  It is somewhat optimized to be
RFI resistant given it is a two-layer board
